The wheel metaphor is derived from positive thinking that propels human being forward. It is related to language and economy;
### Language has two basic building blocks, namely sounds (form) and meaning. Different combination of sounds, syllables, morphemes and words yield different meanings. Different combination of sounds, phonemes, syllables are form of a language. It is the grammar of a language. Different form corresponds to different meanings. Form and meaning are two gears that propels communication. 
### Economy is similar to language in the sense that it has two building blocks, namely money and goods. Money is a unit of account; it is divisible similar to sounds, syllables and words. It represents produced goods. Different combinations of unit of account corresponds to different goods for different goods have different values. So much so that money and goods are two gears of economy. Or money is a wheel while goods are metaphorically a road.
