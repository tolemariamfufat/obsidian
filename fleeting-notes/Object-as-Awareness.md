<p align="justify"> On the basis of modes of knowing, first we are supposed to know that we are not objects. For example we know that we are not stones. Then, at the second stage we know that we have separated ourselves from objects. And we are supposed to identify ourselves with the observer self. We are he/she who knows that he/she knows. At the third level we enter into absolute mode of knowing that consciousness is conscious of its nature. At fourth level we identify ourselves not with though but with invisible body known as heart. At fifth level we return to objects and feel vibration of objects. At sixth level we also visualize objects have invisible body. And at the seventh level we realize our being that we are one with objects that the invisible body is knowing itself. Everything sinks onto itself, that is consciousness</p>
