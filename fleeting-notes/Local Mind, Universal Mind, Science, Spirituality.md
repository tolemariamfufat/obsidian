### Country, for example, Ethiopia is in Local Mind Frame Work. Basically, such a frame of reference is dual, material, not aware of the self. Such frame of reference cannot liberate people. 
### Universal mind set is non-local frame of reference. Universal frame of reference is not thought. It is not mind. But it is awareness. It is not relative. It is absolute. It is immaterial. It is the self. It is awareness. It is knowing. It is the source of everything. Universal awareness liberates people form any kind of bondage.
### Local Mind and Universal awareness are symbolized by two poles of a magnet. The South pole is Local Mind while the Universal awareness is North pole. South pole is attracted towards North pole. North pole indicates directions. 
# Differences b/n Science and Spirituality
### In science matter is the ontological primitive of existence, everything that exists is made up of matter. In spirituality consciousness is the primitive of all existence, everything that exists is made up of consciousness. 
### In science subject object split is underlying the structure of all existences. Subject and object or cause and effect are two different things. But in spirituality subject-object split is illusion because subject and object are entangled realities of one existence. 
### In science matter produces mind, this is, of course, the hard problem of science. In spirituality, mind and matter are complementary activities of awareness. Consciousness modifies itself as cognition and perception. We call cognition mind while perception matter or body. 
### In science reality is observer independent. In spirituality reality includes the observer. Observer is the expression of the reality being observed and vice versa. 
### In science the picture of perception of the world is the human look of it. In spirituality, the picture of perception of the world corresponds to the biological organism that goes with it or entangled with it. Biological organism and perception of the world are complement each other. This is sometimes called bio centrism. 
### In science local realism is the fundamental basis of existence. That is theaters of space-time and cause and effect are real. In spirituality local realism is an illusion known as Maya.

# Similarities b/n Science and Spirituality
### (1) In science matter composed of invisible force fields such as electromagnetism and gravity. In spirituality also reality has a certain level of existence in the form of fluctuations of consciousness that we call mind, intellect and ego. We experience subjectivity as feelings, sensations, emotions, images and thoughts which have force fields.

### (2) In science energetic elementary particles are impermanent and in the quantum field as determined by the uncertainty principle. Similarly, in spirituality, what we call energetic particles fluctuations of consciousness experiences that appear and disappear. Sensations, feelings, images, thought, emotions are determined by uncertainty principles.

### (3) In science, fundamental principles and infinite possibilities that emerge as probability clouds are manifest as elementary particles. In spirituality, the same phenomenon occurs which we call them experiences (we do not call them energetic particles), we call them qualia which emerge as clouds of experiences giving as cognition and perception. 

### (4) In science elementary particles are the most fundamental existence are entangled with other elementary particles through a phenomenon called non-local correlations of a causal quantum mechanical inter relatedness. In spirituality, the same elementary particles as sensations, images, feelings, thoughts, of qualia entangled as a unified experience as a specific experiences of mind-body and universe  known as bio-centrism.

### (5) In science, the world is made of objects. In spirituality, the world is made of experiences. 

### (6) In science, the quantum field is objective reality. In spirituality, consciousness field at a deeper level the quantum field and subjective reality and quantum reality and perceptual reality, cognitive reality, physical reality are complementary experiences of the consciousness field. 

### (7) In current science, the quantum reality is fundamental. In spirituality, if we were to use the word quantum field, it would be the symbolic represent ion of the consciousness field.
