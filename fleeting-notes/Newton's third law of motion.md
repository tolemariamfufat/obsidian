Think that everything you think exists as possibility. So you are infinite being. You can create anything you want by intention. What is your intention for your action. There is an equal and opposite reaction for your action. For example, if you fail to help your colleague for fear of being looked down upon.  Then your intention creates your reality, meaning you will create being looked down upon.
