## Energy Cycles
<p align="justify"> Root Chakra - I know myself as an object so that I focus on food, housing and clothing
Sacral Chakra - I observe "I" that sees myself as an object so that I feel empathy and compassion for others too.
Solar Plexus Chakra - I am awareness that awareness aware of itself; consciousness sinks into itself. 
Heart Chakra - "I" as body-mind sinks to awareness. "I AM" is being. I AM sinks into one with external objects. I AM is being, spaceless, timeless, infinite, omnipresent. 
Throat Chakra - Energy points combined in different ways as sounds combined to form words to create different possible life forms. And as such being vibrates across and in all existence and life forms.
Third Eye Chakra - Being is observed in different forms as optical illusion as entanglement as an Art.
Crown Chakra - Awareness is being created as a separate self. So is crown chakra is the mind, not an awareness. Crown Chakra is the South Pole of a Magnet while Heart Chakra is the North Pole of a Magnet. Throat Chakra is electrical by nature while Third Eye Chakra is Magnetic by nature. Throat Chakra and Third Eye Chakra are electromagnetic waves flowing between Crown Chakra and Heart Chakra. So much so that the Universal Mind (Heart Chakra) is in control of Local Mind (Crown Chakra). So be it!</p>
