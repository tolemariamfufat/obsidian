## Spin, Charge and Inertia
1. Spin is movement; in consciousness terms spin is focused intention and attention. That is focused awareness. Focus on what you want to manifest. 
2. Charge: in consciousness terms charge is transformation. It is the merge of subject-object split. Charge is transcendence. 
3. Inertia: in spiritual terms inertia is meditation. I think these includes practicing let go, acceptance, gratitude, etc. 
4. Focused awareness (intention, attention or plan), meditation (maintaining the flow ) and transcendence (oneness of subject-object) all together form choice-less awareness. 
##  Consciousness as a screen
1. What we see as objective reality outside of us is the dashboard of first experience of the cosmic mind;
2. We are the second witness of the experience of the cosmic mind;
3. The first experience of the cosmic mind and the second witness are in the knowing of the cosmic mind;
## Fundamental Forces of Nature
1. Electromagnetic force - This force is the same as the wheels of form-meaning and money-good relationship; form creates meaning vice versa as money creates good and vices versa. Where there is activity of the sound there is awareness of activity of speech, the activity and its awareness creates form. The activity has negative charge while the awareness has positive charge. That is electrical force. This activity of speech is detached from the self and observed as an object, these creates material object or goods and gives meaning to it. 
2. Weak nuclear force - Weak nuclear force tunnels two or more seemingly opposing and repealing material objects to create a different new substance form repealing elements. Weak nuclear force creates stars. 
3. Strong nuclear force -  awareness wares its self; consciousness is conscious of consciousness.  And as such awareness is intact. Everything is made of awareness, so that everything becomes stable and exist.
4. Gravity - Universe aware of its activities that is gravity.
