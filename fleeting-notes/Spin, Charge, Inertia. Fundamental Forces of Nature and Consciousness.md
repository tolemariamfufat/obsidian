## Spin, Charge and Inertia
1. Spin is movement; in consciousness terms spin is focused intention and attention. That is focused awareness. Focus on what you want to manifest. 
2. Charge: in consciousness terms charge is transformation. It is the merge of subject-object split. Charge is transcendence. So much so that we know two charges:positive and negative. Positive charge in a copper for example is a static substance, it is the aspect that is stable, it is the mass, it is something that knows that it exists in space and time. It is the charge that is ready to share its awareness to the one which lost its awareness. The one that lost its awareness is a negative charge; it is attracted towards the one that accepts it and shares its awareness so that it knows its being. As expected the negative is moves towards the positive to gain its being. Negative pushes away the negative because the negative cannot give awareness to the negative, it thinks that the negative takes its being or awareness. The negative moves across the positive on a copper because the positive attracts the negative but because there is no balance between the negative and the positive, the negative keeps on pushing each other to create the electric current. The negative charge symbolizes the money while the positive charge symbolizes goods. When negative and positive are in balance transaction is made. That means good becomes money and vice versa. 
3. Inertia: in spiritual terms inertia is meditation. I think these includes practicing let go, acceptance, gratitude, diligence, etc. 
4. Focused awareness (intention, attention or plan), meditation (maintaining the flow ) and transcendence (oneness of subject-object) all together form choice-less awareness. 
##  Consciousness as a screen
1. What we see as objective reality outside of us is the dashboard of first experience of the cosmic mind;
2. We are the second witness of the experience of the cosmic mind;
3. The first experience of the cosmic mind and the second witness are in the knowing of the cosmic mind;
## Fundamental Forces of Nature
1. Electromagnetic force - This force is the same as the wheels of form-meaning and money-good relationship; form creates meaning vice versa as money creates good and vices versa. Where there is activity of the sound there is awareness of activity of speech, the activity and its awareness creates form. The activity has negative charge while the awareness has positive charge. That is electrical force. This activity of speech is detached from the self and observed as an object, these creates material object or goods and gives meaning to it. 
2. Weak nuclear force - Weak nuclear force tunnels two or more seemingly opposing and repealing material objects to create a different new substance form repealing elements. Weak nuclear force creates stars. 
3. Strong nuclear force -  awareness wares its self; consciousness is conscious of consciousness.  And as such awareness is intact. Everything is made of awareness, so that everything becomes stable and exist.
4. Gravity - Universe aware of its activities that is gravity.
