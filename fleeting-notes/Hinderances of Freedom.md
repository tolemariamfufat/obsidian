(1) Wrong thinking that you have fixed body-mind personality-this is wrong because your body, though, emotion, sensation, feelings are fluid.
(2) Wrong thinking that you live in present, past, future time of reference. This is wrong because you live now only.
(3) Wrong thinking that you are in control of something or somebody. This wrong because everything in change and flowing.
(4) Wrong thinking that you can resist something or some system. It is wise to go with the flow.
