<p align="justify"> Sensation: sensation is a a felt sens of a body from inside like pain, hunger, pleasure, temperature of air on your skin, and etc. Sensation is the way we experience the body. Perception: perception is the way we experience the world through perceptual modalities such as seeing, smelling, tasting, touching, hearing. Feeling: feeling is a mixture of thought and sensation. Example headache is not an emotion; it is a sensation; by contrast to get angry is a sensation in your body for there is a thought or story that triggers it. Emotion: *sensation*, like anger, and thought or story that triggers it together creates an emotion. These are feelings. Feelings are generated when the inner peace fails. But emotion are what remains. There are two underlying emotions of separate self: feeling of luck and feeling resistance or fear. Consequently the separated mind is offended by exclusion so that it want a group or host to satisfy sense of belonging. It excludes others to satisfy its sense of vengeance. It also resists to change and once it gets dominant position it terribly gets others terrorized. It wants to get everybody in control of its regime. If conditions are not favorable for vengeance, it gets depressed . </p>
