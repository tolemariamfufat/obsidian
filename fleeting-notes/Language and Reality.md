- Form and Meaning: form and meaning are the same as electromagnetic force. If you move magnet it creates electric current. Similarly if you move form, if you combine sounds-consonants and vowels- in different ways, it creates meaning. Vowels are like positive charges while consonants are like negative charge of electric current. In a similar way, if you happen to move these meanings, if you use them in different contexts and in different orders, you create forms, you end up deriving different forms form the same underlying form. Example, you can derive *diimate* (v) from *diimaa*(n). In this case *aa* is dropped while *at* is created. 
- The most fundamental aspects of grammar are nouns and verbs. More fundamental are pronouns and verb to be. *I Am*. Pronoun and verb to be. Nouns represent pronouns. I do not agree that pronouns represent nouns. Adjectives in praise/blaspheme of pronouns. They move in wards to the pronouns. While determiners move out ward from pronouns as they manifest the pronouns. Adverbs move in wards to verbs so that they express time, place, manner, etc. There are two basic cases-subject and object. Pre-post positions add directional perspectives to an event.
