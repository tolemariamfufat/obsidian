<p align="justify"> On the basis of modes of knowing, first we are supposed to know that we are not objects. For example we know that we are not stones. Then, at the second stage we know that we have separated ourselves from objects. And we are supposed to identify ourselves with the observer self. We are he/she who knows that he/she knows. At the third level we enter into absolute mode of knowing that consciousness is conscious of its nature. At fourth level we identify ourselves not with though but with invisible body known as heart. At fifth level we return to objects and feel vibration of objects. At sixth level we also visualize objects have invisible body. And at the seventh level we realize our being that we are one with objects that the invisible body is knowing itself. Everything sinks onto itself, that is consciousness</p>
<p align="justify"> All that is known is knowing. And it is knowing that knows knowing. All that is being experienced at the moment is knowing/consciousness. Consciousness modulating itself in the form of finite mind that is consciousness modulating itself in the form of thought and perception. In the form of thought it appears to itself as time; in the form of perception it appears to itself as space. In other words, time and space are consciousness modulated through thought and perception.</p> Rupert Spira https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-IIzAblVlg

1. The imperturbability of our nature irrespective of thoughts, sensations and perceptions is known as PEACE. 
2. The absence of resistance of NOW is known as HAPPINESS. 
3. The absolute absence of the subject that knows and the object that is known is called LOVE.

<p align="justify" > I am is pure consciousness. I am is fundamental irreducible, border less, incomprehensible, infinite, inconceivable, in-perceivable. I am is the subject of all experience. The mind is the modified form of pure consciousness. </p>
