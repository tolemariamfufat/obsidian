### Country, for example, Ethiopia is in Local Mind Frame Work. Basically, such a frame of reference is dual, material, not aware of the self. Such frame of reference cannot liberate people. 
### Universal mind set is non-local frame of reference. Universal frame of reference is not thought. It is not mind. But it is awareness. It is not relative. It is absolute. It is immaterial. It is the self. It is awareness. It is knowing. It is the source of everything. Universal awareness liberates people form any kind of bondage.
### Local Mind and Universal awareness are symbolized by two poles of a magnet. The South pole is Local Mind while the Universal awareness is North pole. South pole is attracted towards North pole. North pole indicates directions.
