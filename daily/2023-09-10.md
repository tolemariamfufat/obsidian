I have been suffering from headache the whole night may be because my third eye is opening. I visualized infinite being of myself after I learned focusing on my heart at the right side my chest as Sir Ramada Maharshi said. I have also understood the 7 energy cycles:
- I as subject act on an object, I differentiate my self from an object that is outside of my self- this root chakra.
- I observe my self as acting on object outside of my self-this sacred chakra;
- I I make sure that that I know that I observe my self and form opinion of my self; I think before I speak- that solar plexus chakra;
- I know that I am part of the infinite being and I feel and sense my infinite being as different from my body-that is heart chakra;
- I sense that my infinite being is vibrating through out the universe-that is throat chakra;
- I visualize my infinite being as appearing as different images in various ways in different universes- that is third eye chakra;
- I know that I am knowing and converge to an object and the same as an object, manifested as an object on knowing screen and cycles through all chakras as knowing-that is crown chakra.
