## From Sir Ramana Maharshi's teachings:
- ###  B: Know yourself before you seek to know the nature of God and the world
- ### D: Does knowing myself imply knowing God?
- ### B: Yes, God is within you.
- ### D: Then, what stands in the way of my knowing myself or God?
- ### B: Your wandering mind and perverted ways.
- ### D: I am a weak creature. But why does not the superior power of the Lord within remove the obstacles?
- ### B: Yes, He will, if you have the aspiration.
- ### D: Why should He not create aspiration in me?
- ### B: Then surrender yourself.
- ### D: If I surrender myself, is no prayer to God necessary?
- ### B: Surrender itself is a mighty prayer.
- ### D: But is it not necessary to understand His nature before one surrenders oneself?
- ### B: If you believe that God will do all the things that you want Him to do, then surrender yourself to Him. Otherwise let God alone, and know yourself. If there be true surrender, there can be no complaint or frustration.
