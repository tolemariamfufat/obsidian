I have been reading on diodes and transistors. About silicon, phosphorus doping and aluminum doping. And about transistors as a switch and power amplifier. How binaries such as (0,1), (true, false), (on, off) are formed as a computer language. I understood that power is basic. Transistors are based on energy transfer. In this case power is the same as money in business. The bottom line is that power is awareness. Feelings and sensations are objective realities as manifested knowing.  For local mind, what we call electric power and money is pure awareness in universal mind. What we call objective reality in local mind is a representation or true reality in the universal mind. Amazing.
